USER INSTRUCTIONS:
This game mimics the game Asteroids. The point of the game is to 
score as many points as possible by shooting asteroids with your 
spaceship. The spaceship will explode if it collides with an asteroid. 
After destroying all of the asteroids on one level another level will 
begin with one additional asteroid. The amount of points that you score 
is indicated by the score in the upper left corner. The triangles 
represent how many remaining lives that you have. If your spaceship is 
destroyed by an asteroid pressing the R key will reset your spaceship. 
If you travel off one side of the screen you will come back on the other side.

Use left arrow key to rotate the spaceship counter clockwise
